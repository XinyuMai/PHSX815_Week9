# PHSX815_Week9

## HW10

* Write a program that can find the minimum of a function that you define. Unlike homework #9, the function must now be at least 2-dimensional (higher dimensions fine too - doesn't have to be complicated).

* We are minimizing function `f(x,y) = (x-2)^2 + y^2`

* see jupyter notebook `minimize_3d.ipynb`
